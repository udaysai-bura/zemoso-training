  <h1>Java Programming Language</h1>

  <p>
    Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems
    (now Oracle). It is designed to be simple, secure, and platform-independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of Java’s biggest strengths is <Strong>"Write Once, Run Anywhere"</Strong>. Java programs are
    compiled into bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing the same
    program to work on different operating systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Java is widely used in web applications, Android development, enterprise software,
    cloud systems, and backend services. It offers strong memory management, garbage collection,
    and a rich standard library.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to its reliability, scalability, and large community support, Java remains one of the
    most popular programming languages in the world.
